						Profile:</b> Before you invest, it’s important
					to
					understand what kind of investor you are which means
					knowing your willingness and ability to
					accept risk, your investment time horizon and your
					objectives. Try the Investor
					Questionnaire to begin to learn some insights into
					factors such as your investment time
					frame and your comfort level with investment risk.
					While this questionnaire can serve as a
					useful starting point for discussions with your
					financial advisor, it’s important to
					understand that this is a not a substitute for a
					thorough risk assessment with a financial
					advisor.
